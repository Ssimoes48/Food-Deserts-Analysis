Project Title: Health in Food Deserts Description: Evaluate health status of residents in counties with and without food deserts.
Hypothesis: The presence of a food desert in a county results in decreased health status for residents of that county.

Research Questions:
Do residents of counties with food deserts have reduced health status, as measured by various health factors (e.g. premature death, adult obesity, diabetes)

    Parse data by common characteristic (i.e. county)
    Show food deserts on a heat map (for density)
    Show health status for various health factors on a heat map (for density)
    Overlays:
        premature death and food desert maps
        adult obesity and food desert maps
        premature death and food desert maps
        diabetes and food desert maps
    Comparison of these health parameters in counties with food deserts, versus in counties without.
        Pick representative counties from each group and dive deeper into data
        Pie plots health factor for counties with and without food desert.
        other plots as needed
