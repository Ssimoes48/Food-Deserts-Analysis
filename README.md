Project Title:  Crime Rates in Food Deserts 
Description:  Evaluate presence of crime and types of crime in counties with and without food deserts. 
Determine if certain types of crime are higher in food deserts.  Analysis could be used to support other 
socioeconomic analysis related to funding and improvements (e.g. environmental justice).  

Research Questions:  
Is the rate of crime higher in areas with food deserts?  
What type of crime is highest in areas with food deserts?  
* Parse data by common characteristic (i.e. county)
* Show food deserts on a heat map (for density) 
* Show crime rate on a heat map (for density)
* Overlays:
	- crime rate and food desert maps 
	- types of crime and food desert maps
	- other maps as needed
* Comparison of crime in counties with food deserts, versus in counties without.
	- Pick representative counties from each group and dive deeper into data
	- Pie plot by crime type for counties with and without food desert.
	- other plots as needed
