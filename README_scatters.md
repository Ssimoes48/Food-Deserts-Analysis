README - Scatter Plot and Linear Regression Analysis: 

1 - Our first approach involved the assessment of both health factors and socioeconomic factors related to access to 
healthy foods. However, our analytical approach and evaluation morphed with time.  

Initial Scatter Plot Evaluations: 
- % Adult Obesity as a function of % Poverty Rate (% of county pop below the poverty line) 
- # Diabetic Medicare Enrollees Per County as a function of % Poverty Rate 
- # Deaths Per County as a function of % Poverty Rate (% of county pop below the poverty line) 
- % Adult Obesity as a function of % Food Environment Index Rating

and linear regression analysis.  

First, I evaluated the following relationships:
