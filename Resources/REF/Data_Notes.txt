## ditched this approach, too complicated 

Median family income might not be useful because it has been skewed by wealthier families in each county 
	(very rarely will the entire county be poor). we need something to compare it to. 

For instance:  
National poverty level income is:  https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines 
- 21,720 for a family of 2
- 26,200 for a family of 4

These are so low!  Let's look at minimum wage:  https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/wages/minimumwage
- 7.25 per hour x 2080 working hours per year = 15,080
- let's assume a couple each makes minimum wage, so 30,160 per household.   
- now lets look at some other arbitrary incomes:
	45,000
	70,000
	100,000
