## General info
To begin our analysis, we gathered data split up by census tract. We found information on factors such as diabetes, medicare enrollment, obesity, race, and self-reported fair/poor health, all distinguished by census data. We then merged the datasets and began studying the data. For the pie/donut chart visualization, I used Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to split, analyze, and visualize the data.
